## Exploring the Association Between Discharge Destination on Stroke Patient Outcomes

Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in Canada and the issue of overcrowding and understaffing in emergency departments plays a significant role in how and where stroke patients are discharged.
This study aims to identify how different discharge destinations following stroke hospitalization, negatively or positively impact patient health outcomes. Using the International Stroke Trial: Version 2 dataset, we compared baseline characteristics and performed an initial Kaplan Meier analysis to estimate the trends in survival probabilities. For statistical analysis, we identified the predicted 6 month mortality of ischaemic stroke patients in different discharge destinations through Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. In doing so, we were able to adjust for confounders, handle administratively censored data, and generate hazard ratios that quantify the risk of each discharge destination. Due to the varying degrees of care offered at different discharge destinations, we hypothesized that the destinations with consistent quality of care and support will be associated with better health outcomes. 
The average age of our cohort (n=9,569) was 69.9 years (Â±11.8). Results from our Cox regression indicate nursing home discharges increase the risk of 6 month mortality by 105% (HR:2.054 [1.848-2.259]) and other hospital departments discharges increase the risk of 6 month mortality by 101% (HR:2.012 [1.849-2.174]). These findings suggest the need for further research into informed decision-making around stroke care plans and improvements in resource allocation and quality of care for proper prevention, care, and rehabilitation of stroke patients.
